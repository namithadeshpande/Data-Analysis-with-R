# Data Analysis with R
## Description
This repository contains my exploratory data analysis projects using R and several other packages included in Tidyverse. All source code for these projects can be found down below.

## Projects List
- [Analyzing Forest Fires Data](https://github.com/namithadeshpande/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/Analyzing-Forest-Fire-Data.Rmd) - This project performs exploratory data analysis to show which months and days of the week had greater number of forest fires. 
- [Association Rules](https://github.com/namithadeshpande/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/Association_Rules.Rmd) - In this project, I have used the titanic dataset to perform association rule mining to determine which class of passengers survived the tragedy using the `arules` and `arulesViz` packages.
- [Basic COVID-19 Analysis](https://github.com/namithadeshpande/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/Basic_COVID_Analysis.Rmd) - This project performs a simple analysis using `Hmisc` package to determine which age group and gender has higher chances of death from the virus.
- [EDA of Diamonds Dataset](https://github.com/namithadeshpande/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/Diamonds_Data_EDA.Rmd) - This project uses the `diamonds` dataset of `ggplot2` package to perform exploratory data analysis using few statistical methods such as summary statistics, hypothesis tests and statistical distributions
- [Investigating COVID Virus Trends](https://github.com/namithadeshpande/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/Investigating-COVID-Virus-Trends.Rmd) - This project performs kaggle data analysis to understand which country has the highest number of cases against total number of testing performed using `tidyverse` package. 
- [NYC School Perceptions](https://github.com/namithadeshpande/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/NYC_School_Survey_Data.Rmd) - Responses to surveys designed to gauge parent, student, and teacher perceptions of the quality of New York City schools.  In this project, the following questions are answered: 
* Do student, teacher, and parent perceptions of NYC school quality appear to be related to demographic and academic success metrics? 
* Do students, teachers, and parents have similar perceptions of NYC school quality?
- [Text Mining Emily Bronte Novels](https://github.com/namithadeshpande/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/Emily_bronte.R) - This Project involved Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis to predict the tone of the book using `gutenbergr` package. 
- [Titanic Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/namithadeshpande/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/Titanic_data_analysis.Rmd) - This project contains Exploratory Data Analysis results of the titanic dataset that is publically available on Kaggle. I have used the following packages `readr`, `dplyr` and `ggplot2` of tidyverse
