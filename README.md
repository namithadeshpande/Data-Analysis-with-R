# Text Mining with R
## Description
Recently, I happen to come across [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) written by [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/) and [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) while exploring different datasets and packages available in R and was immediately drawn towards it. I had no prior knowledge about text mining or sentimental analysis, and I decided to read the book and put my knowledge into practice. 

This Repository contains code for Sentiment analysis with text mining using gutenbergr package on Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights using R programming language. This novel is dark. No wonder that it was received with mixed reviews when its first edition was published in 1847. 
The UTF-8 plain text file for this novel was sourced from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) using ```gutenbergr``` package. Project Gutenberg provides over 60,000 books.

## Pre-requisites
- R installation

## Installation
Install the required package as follows
``` 
install.packages(gutenbergr)
library(gutenbergr)
```
## Dependencies
The following are the other main packages required. 
- dplyr, tidytext, ggplot2, tidyr, wordcloud, reshape2, viridis, ggthemes
- Install these packages using the code snippet in the installation step.

## Steps for Execution
- The entire code for this project is present in ```Emily_bronte.R```
- I have also attached visualization pictures in this repository
